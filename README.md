 This is a small nodejs project which runs restful services with express. It uses MongoDB as database, jwt for user authorization and authentication, also uses swagger to present api spec for the services.

2. cd into the repo path in terminal
3. make sure node.js is installed(better to be lastest version), run `npm install` and wait for a few seconds
4. make sure you have mongodb installed and without password
5. run `nodemon index` under the repo path in terminal
